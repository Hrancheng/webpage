            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I am a senior year student at University of Michigan, with major in Computer Science and Statistics. Last summer I 
                worked as a software engineer intern @DeepGlint, a computer vision startup in Beijing. I am currently looking for full-time research 
                opportunities in computer vision and machine learning.

                <h3>Android app with RNN for voice identification</h3>
                <p>This is an Android app we developed with RNN model, able to identify Quran verses with 
                    the users' recitation. We use Python package to transform voice information to Numpy array.
                    And trained the model with peak loss smaller than 0.1. We collected ground-truth data from Youtube
                    recitation videos. We are still working to improve the accuracy of the model and publish the app to Google Play Store.

                    of three classical super resolution: SRCNNN, SRGAN and Bicubic.
