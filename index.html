            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I am Haoran Cheng, a senior year student at University of Michigan,majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. Last summer I 
                worked as a software engineer intern @DeepGlint, a computer vision startup in Beijing. I am currently looking for full-time research 
                opportunities in computer vision and machine learning.

                <h3>Android app with RNN for voice identification</h3>
                <p>This is an Android app we developed with RNN model, able to identify Quran verses with 
                    the users' recitation. We use Python package to transform voice information to Numpy array.
                    And trained the model with peak loss smaller than 0.1. We collected ground-truth data from Youtube
                    recitation videos. We are still working to improve the accuracy of the model and publish the app to Google Play Store.

                <h3>Super resolution technique implementation: SRCNN, SRGAN and Bicubic</h3>
                <p>Submitted as the final project for undergraduate-level computer vision course, we built wheel to compare complexity and efficiency
                    of three classical super resolution: SRCNNN, SRGAN and Bicubic. we run and reimplement one traditional technique Bicubic Interpolation and two deep learning methods SRCNN and SRGAN
                    over one common dataset DIV2K dataset to compare them
                    in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

                <h3>Team strength estimation based on Bradley-Terry
                    model with data from NCAA women's basketball</h3>
                <p>AWe test 6 different models to see which one does the best job
                    of predicting who will win the NCAA tournament. Those models differ in whether to incorporate home
                    advantage variable and date interaction term, as well as whether there is penalty term added to the model
                    formula. and then from there we use cross-validation to compute negative log likelihood loss, hoping to
                    see which model to prefer and then ranking the teams based on the model.

                <h3>Bayesian analysis of factors causing heart disease</h3>
                <p>We use Bayesian model to analyze the factors causing heart disease. Also, we use Markov Chain Monte
                    Carlo simulation to assess the performance of our proposed models. To effectively facilitate our
                    computational process, we randomly sample 4000 observations as our dataset of interest.
